First Odin Project
Code editor started doing something weird that so I had to comment out lines that it wouldn't recognize html tags on.
Also I am not good with git or git hub so that was a struggle.  Hoping this is uploaded correctly.
The issue is I was trying to style a little in HTML within the allowable parameters since I am beginning to learn CSS. I will come back and update the code to reflect CSS styling once I get more accustomed with it.
